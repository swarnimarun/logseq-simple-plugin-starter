## logseq-simple-plugin-starter

A well setup vanilla-typescript logseq plugin development starter.

You can add other things on top of this if you know what you are doing but I would recommend using a specialized starter if your requirements are not:

- Very simple and light
- Quick setup and no-extras
- Using typescript

WHEN NOT TO USE THIS:
- You NEED entry point as a `index.html` (such as if it's a react app or something)

## FAQ

Feel free to let me know if I missed something, this was written purely because entire logseq ecosystem had a lack of proper starter templates for plugins and I needed one to write a quick plugin that I had in mind.

This is meant as a starter for things that are generally script only or don't require entire bloated frameworks, please don't ask me how to use it with anything like that.
